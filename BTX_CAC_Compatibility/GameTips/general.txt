Some weapons have different firing modes/ammo types, each having its own effect.
ECM works differently than you are used to. It now gives any affected Mech +4 defense (not only against missles), prevents indirect fire and prevents being sensorlocked.
Having a Beagle Active Probe lets you use Sensor Lock and Active Probe Ping for free. Yes, Sensorlock that pesky light and immediately shoot it.
Different auras have different colors: blue -> ECM   brown -> Active Probe range   green -> Improved Comms   red -> AMS
Improved Comms Mech Quirk now allows to sensorlock mechs covered by ECM.
You can mount an Active Probe and an ECM in any mech, if you have the space for it.
Missing new shiny fixed equipment on your Mech? Store it, then ready it again. This refreshes fixed equipment.
AMS shoots at enemy missles in range (Red aura). This in turn means that it tries to shoot down an indirect LRM a lot more often than a SRM fired one hex away.
