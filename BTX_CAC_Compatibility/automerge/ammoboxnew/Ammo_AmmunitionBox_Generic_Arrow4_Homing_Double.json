Ammo Bins will explode and destroy their installed location when they receive a Critical Hit.\n\nHoming Arrow IV missiles will home in onto one target, specified by a friendly TAG. If no target can be found, it is designed to self-destruct before impact. Due to the targeting happeing in flight, homing missiles will be fired immediately.\n\nArrow IV Homing Ammo (Double) Bins each contain 13 rounds and may feed multiple weapons.",
