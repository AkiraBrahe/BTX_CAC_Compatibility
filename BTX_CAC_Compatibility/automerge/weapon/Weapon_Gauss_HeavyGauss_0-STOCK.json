		"Details": "A Gauss Rifle uses electromagnetic charges to accelerate metallic rounds at extremely high speed, dealing massive damage by kinetic force alone. Heavy Gauss Rifles hit harder than any other weapon. However, this comes at the expense of weight, range, and severely limited ammunition. Unlike other Gauss Rifles the Heavy Gauss Rifle does suffer a slight recoil effect from firing.\n\nGauss Rifles explode if destroyed, taking the entire mounted location with them."
