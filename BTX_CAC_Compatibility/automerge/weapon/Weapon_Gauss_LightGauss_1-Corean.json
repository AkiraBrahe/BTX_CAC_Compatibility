		"Details": "A Gauss Rifle uses electromagnetic charges to accelerate metallic rounds at extremely high speed, dealing massive damage by kinetic force alone. The slug and damage caused by the Light Gauss Rifle is decreased in size, although the rifle is able to propel the smaller slug farther. Unlike Autocannons, Gauss Rifles do not suffer recoil effects from firing.\n\nGauss Rifles explode if destroyed, taking the entire mounted location with them."
