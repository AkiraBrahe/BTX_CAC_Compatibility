		"Details": "The LRM10 rack of Long-Range Missiles occupies a supporting fire role when mounted on most units, with fairly low damage balanced by low heat and ammunition consumption. Like all LRMs, LRM10s are capable of indirect fire over obstacles and terrain with the benefit of a spotter unit. Clan LRMs do not have a minimum range.\n\nMissile weapons have a negative accuracy modifier that is percentage based and applied after the standard To Hit chance is calculated. LRM weapons accuracy modifier can be positively affected by an attached Artemis IV FCS or Narc Homing Pod on the target (not both)."
