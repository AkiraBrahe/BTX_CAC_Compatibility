Like all LRMs, LRM15s are capable of indirect fire over obstacles and terrain with the benefit of a spotter unit. Clan LRMs do not have a minimum range.\n\nMissile weapons have a negative accuracy modifier that is percentage based and applied after the standard To Hit chance is calculated. LRM weapons accuracy modifier can be positively affected by an attached Artemis IV FCS or Narc Homing Pod on the target (not both)."
