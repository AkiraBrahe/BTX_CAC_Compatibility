		"Details": "Clan Star Adder developed the family of Heavy Lasers in 3059 as a way of packing more punch into a relatively small package. All Heavy Lasers, however, build a tremendous amount of heat and interfere with a 'Mech's sensors. A subtle firing delay and interference with a BattleMech's sensors means that a Heavy Medium Laser suffers with accuracy loss."
