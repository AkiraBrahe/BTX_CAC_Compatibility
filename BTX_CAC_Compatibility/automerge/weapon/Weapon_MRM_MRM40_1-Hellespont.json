The MRM-40 is the largest and bulkiest of the MRMs. MRMs suffer a baseline innacuracy over other missile systems, but are more accurate than Dead-Fire modified LRMs.\n\nMissile weapons have a negative accuracy modifier that is percentage based and applied after the standard To Hit chance is calculated. MRM weapons accuracy modifier is not affected by a Narc Homing Pod on the target."
