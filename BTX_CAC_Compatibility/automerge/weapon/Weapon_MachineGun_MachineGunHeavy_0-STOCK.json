Twice as heavy as its more traditional cousin, the Heavy Machine Gun does increased damage, though at the cost of a third of its already short range. Heavy Machine Guns, like their smaller predecessors have a greatly increased chance to cause Criticals when they impact a target that has been stripped of its armor.\n\nRequired Hardpoint: <b><color=#008000>Support</color></b>"
