		"Details": "The Improved Narc Missile Beacon launcher is designed to fire a single, highly specialized missile that deploys a homing beacon upon impact. The attached beacon transmits data to allied units, causing the linked target to receive a better Missile accuracy modifier for standard LRM, NLRM or SRM based attacks. Artemis IV linked weaponry cannot benefit from a Narc Missile Beacon. The Improved Narc Missile Beacon was developed by Comstar and boasts improved range."
