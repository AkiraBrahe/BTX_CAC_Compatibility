As for all SRMs, SRM4 shots deal above-average stability impact per hit compared to other weapons.\n\nMissile weapons have a negative accuracy modifier that is percentage based and applied after the standard To Hit chance is calculated. SRM weapons accuracy modifier can be positively affected by an attached Artemis IV FCS or Narc Homing Pod on the target (not both)."
