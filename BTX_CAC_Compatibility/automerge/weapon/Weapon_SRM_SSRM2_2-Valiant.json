As for all SRMs, SRM2 shots deal above-average stability impact per hit compared to other weapons. The Streak Missile Launcher is a specialized version of the standard Short Range Missile launcher which withholds fire until it receives a solid lock ensuring all missiles will hit. If the launcher cannot gain a lock on the target the missiles won't fire.\n\nUnlike other missile systems, Streak based weaponry does not suffer from a Missile accuracy modifier, unless the target is using an active Anti Missile System."
