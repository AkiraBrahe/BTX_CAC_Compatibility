    "Details": "Prototype TSM is the early manufacture version of TSM. This formula was created by the Capellan Confederation as a result of receiving a 'leak' from the Federated Suns in 3028. It delivers significantly improved performance when the 'Mech is at 27+ heat at the end of it's turn. Under these conditions the 'Mech will move faster and deal double damage with melee attacks (Not DFA).",
